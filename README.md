# Angular2 Firebase example app

I've decided to switch to [angular2-mdl](https://github.com/mseemann/angular2-mdl) instead of [material2](https://github.com/mseemann/angular2-mdl), the project has been moved here:
[https://github.com/creativedeveloper-net/angular2-mdl-firebase/](https://github.com/creativedeveloper-net/angular2-mdl-firebase/)

The project currently is in early stage
[Live demo](https://angular2-test-9dceb.firebaseapp.com)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.18.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
